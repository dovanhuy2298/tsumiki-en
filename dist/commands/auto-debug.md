Fix test errors.
First, run all test cases to check and set test case errors to todos
Then for each target, perform the following work:

- Investigate the detailed causes of test errors using tasks
- Use /tdd-green with new tasks to fix errors
  Finally, check the overall test success rate and report
  Goal is to increase the number of successful test cases
  NEVER: Skip tests
  NEVER: Delete existing test cases

# TDD Verify Complete

## Purpose

Verify the completeness of TDD development by checking test case implementation status, requirements coverage, and overall quality. Determine whether to proceed to the next TDD cycle or require additional implementation.

## Prerequisites

- TDD development has progressed through Red, Green, and Refactor phases
- Test cases have been implemented and are passing
- Requirements definition documents exist
- Implementation files are available

## Execution Content

### 1. Test Case Implementation Status Verification

- Check all planned test cases from requirements definition
- Verify implementation status of each test case
- Confirm test execution results (pass/fail)
- Count number of implemented test cases
- Compare each test case content with plans

### 2. Requirements Coverage Analysis

- Check requirements definition document (`requirements.md`)
- Verify implementation status of each requirement item
- Calculate requirements coverage rate
- Identify unimplemented requirement items
- Assess quality of implemented requirements

### 3. Implementation Status Analysis and TODO.md Update Determination

Please provide analysis results in the following format:

```

---

_Integrate important information from existing memo content, remove duplicates and detailed progress records_

````

**Integration Update Rules:**

1. **Important Information Retention**: Integrate technical learning points and reusable patterns from existing memos
2. **Duplicate Removal**: Consolidate similar records and detailed progress into latest information
3. **Simplification**: Keep only final results for details like dates and numbers
4. **Reusability Priority**: Prioritize information useful for future development
5. **Related Information Priority**: Prioritize information like specifications

#### Original Task File Completion Mark Automatic Update

When verification is complete, automatically update the original task file with the following steps:

1. **Identify Completed Task**: Identify current TDD development target task from original task file
2. **Add Completion Mark**: Add `‚úÖ **Complete**` mark to corresponding task
3. **Record Completion Reason**: Add `(TDD development complete - [test count] test cases all passed)`
4. **Update Subtasks**: Add `[x]` checkmarks to related subtasks

Example:

```markdown
### 1. JSON File Path Argument Processing Function ‚úÖ **Complete** (TDD development complete - 15 test cases all passed)

- [x] Add functionality to receive JSON file path via command line arguments
- [x] Support multiple JSON file paths (read entire sample/ directory)
- [x] Argument validation functionality
````

### 6. Corresponding Actions

#### When Implementation is Complete

Display the following message along with recommended next commands:

```
‚úÖ Test case completeness verification: Pass
- Planned test cases: [number] all implemented
- Test success rate: 100%

Next recommended step: Start next TDD cycle with `/tdd-cycle`.
```

**Memo File Recording**: Automatically append verification results to memo file.
**Original Task File Update**: Automatically add ‚úÖ completion mark to completed tasks.

#### When Implementation is Insufficient

Provide the following message and record the situation:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Test case implementation shortage detected

There are [number] unimplemented test cases.
The following content has been recorded in memo file:

[List of unimplemented test cases]

**Important**: No corrections are made in this process.

## English Quick Guide

This document includes Japanese examples below. Use this section as an English-first summary.

- Goal: Split implementation into phased task files under `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-*.md` with daily granularity and clear dependencies.
- Task metadata per item: Task ID, Name, Type (TDD/DIRECT), Requirements link, Dependencies, Implementation details, Test requirements, UI/UX requirements, Completion conditions.
- Phases: Create `overview.md` plus `phase1.md`, `phase2.md`, ... each listing day-level tasks with checkboxes and milestones.
- Numbering: Use `TASK-0001` format, assign consecutively across files without duplication.
- Output files:
  - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-overview.md`
  - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-phase1.md`, `-phase2.md`, ...
- After generation: verify inter-file links, dependency records, 4-digit ID format, and phase completion criteria.

See the detailed Japanese templates and Mermaid examples below.

## Purpose

Based on design documents, split implementation tasks into daily granularity and organize them into monthly phases. Create individual task files for each phase and manage them in appropriate order considering dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Design documents exist in `docs/design/{requirement-name}/`
- Design has been approved by user (or approval is omitted)
- `docs/tasks/` directory exists (create if it doesn't exist)

## Execution Content

**„ÄêReliability Level Instructions„Äë**:
For each item, comment on the verification status with original materials (including EARS requirements definition and design documents) using the following signals:

- üü¢ **Green Signal**: When referring to EARS requirements definition and design documents with minimal speculation
- üü° **Yellow Signal**: When making reasonable speculation based on EARS requirements definition and design documents
- üî¥ **Red Signal**: When speculation is not based on EARS requirements definition and design documents

1. **Design Document Analysis**

   - Search for design documents using @agent-symbol-searcher and read found files with Read tool
   - Read `docs/design/{requirement-name}/architecture.md` with Read tool
   - Read `docs/design/{requirement-name}/database-schema.sql` with Read tool
   - Read `docs/design/{requirement-name}/api-endpoints.md` with Read tool
   - Read `docs/design/{requirement-name}/interfaces.ts` with Read tool
   - Read `docs/design/{requirement-name}/dataflow.md` with Read tool

2. **Existing Task File Verification**

   - Search for existing task IDs using @agent-symbol-searcher and read found task files with Read tool
   - Read existing `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-*.md` files with Read tool
   - Extract used task numbers (TASK-0001 format)
   - Assign non-overlapping numbers for new tasks

3. **Task Identification**

   - Foundation tasks (DB setup, environment construction, etc.)
   - Backend tasks (API implementation)
   - Frontend tasks (UI implementation)
   - Integration tasks (E2E testing, etc.)

4. **Dependency Analysis**

   - Clarify dependencies between tasks
   - Identify tasks that can be executed in parallel
   - Identify critical path

5. **Task Detailing**
   Include the following for each task:

   - Task ID (4-digit number in TASK-0001 format)
   - Task name
   - Task Type (TDD/DIRECT)
     - **TDD**: Coding, business logic implementation, UI implementation, test implementation, etc. development work
     - **DIRECT**: Environment setup, configuration file creation, documentation creation, build configuration, etc. preparation work
   - Requirements link
   - Dependent tasks
   - Implementation details
   - Unit test requirements
   - Integration test requirements
   - UI/UX requirements (if applicable)
     - Loading states
     - Error display
     - Mobile compatibility
     - Accessibility requirements

6. **Task Ordering**

   - Determine execution order based on dependencies
   - Set milestones
   - Group tasks that can be executed in parallel

7. **Phase Division and File Creation**
   - Divide tasks into phases of approximately 1 month duration
   - Create individual task files for each phase
   - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-overview.md`: Overall overview and phase list
   - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-phase1.md`: Phase 1 detailed tasks
   - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-phase2.md`: Phase 2 detailed tasks
   - (Continue according to number of phases)
   - Design each task with daily granularity
   - Add checkboxes to each task to track completion status

## Subtask Template

### For TDD Tasks

Each task is implemented with the following TDD process:

1. `tdd-requirements.md` - Detailed requirements definition
2. `tdd-testcases.md` - Test case creation
3. `tdd-red.md` - Test implementation (failure)
4. `tdd-green.md` - Minimal implementation
5. `tdd-refactor.md` - Refactoring
6. `tdd-verify-complete.md` - Quality verification

### For DIRECT Tasks

Each task is implemented with the following DIRECT process:

1. `direct-setup.md` - Direct implementation & configuration
2. `direct-verify.md` - Operation verification & quality verification
````

## Post-execution Verification

- Verify consistency between created tasks and existing system using @agent-symbol-searcher
- Display list of created files
  - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-overview.md`: Overall overview and phase list
  - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-phase1.md`: Phase 1 details
  - `docs/tasks/{requirement-name}-phase2.md`: Phase 2 details
  - (Continue according to number of phases)
- Display overview and task count for each phase
- Display overall schedule and dependencies
- Report project duration and total workload
- **Display existing task number verification results**
  - Used numbers extracted from existing files
  - Starting number for new tasks
  - Verify consecutive number assignment without duplication
- Display message prompting user confirmation to start implementation

## File Link Verification

- Verify that links from overview.md to each phase\*.md are correctly set
- Verify that task dependencies within each phase file are correctly recorded
- **Verify that all task IDs are unified in 4-digit TASK-0001 format**
- Verify that milestones and phase completion criteria are clearly defined

## Task Number Management Notes

- Always check used numbers with Grep tool if existing files exist
- Support maximum 9999 tasks from TASK-0001 to TASK-9999
- Carefully manage to prevent number duplication or gaps
- Assign task numbers consecutively even across multiple phase files

# 7.1 Experimental Project Results

## Overview

By applying AITDD methods to small-scale experimental projects, we achieved dramatic efficiency improvements compared to traditional development methods. This section explains in detail the quantitative results and newly discovered challenges.

## Dramatic Improvement in Development Efficiency

### Changes in Implementation Speed

**Traditional Development Methods**

- Typical implementation time: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)
- Gradual manual implementation process
- Heavily dependent on individual skills

**After AITDD Introduction**

- Implementation time for equivalent functionality: Under 1 hour
- **Efficiency improvement ratio: 20-48 times improvement**
- Stable results through structured processes

### Implementation Process Characteristics

AITDD implementation adopted the following characteristic processes:

- **Automated execution**: Sequential execution of each step through shell scripts
- **Simplified time management**: No manual time measurement, natural flow progression
- **Quality focus**: Prioritize quality assurance over efficiency
- **Continuous iteration**: Reliable execution of Red-Green-Refactor-Validation cycles

## Achievement of Quality Improvement

### High-Quality Code Generation

- **Refactoring process**: Achieve high quality through systematic refactoring processes
- **Validation step**: Quality assurance through comprehensive quality management
- **Test-first approach**: Robust implementation through pre-test design

### Quality Assessment Criteria

Five quality assessment criteria used in actual projects:

1. **Test results**: All tests continue to pass
2. **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities discovered
3. **Performance**: No critical performance issues discovered
4. **Refactoring quality**: Goals achieved
5. **Code quality**: Improved to appropriate level

## Discovery of New Challenges

### Fundamental Change in Work Nature

AITDD introduction significantly changed the nature of development work:

**Traditional Work**

- Check code written by oneself in understood state
- Implementation work is primary
- Gradual quality improvement

**Work After AITDD**

- Detailed code review of generated code
- Confirmation and verification work is primary
- AI output quality management is important

### Increase in Quality Management Costs

**New Cost Elements**

- Quality confirmation work for AI-generated code
- Validity verification of inferred parts
- Legitimacy confirmation of test cases
- Consistency confirmation with design intent

**Typical Problem Patterns**

- **Unintended existing code modifications**: Independent modifications beyond instruction scope
- **Over-implementation through excessive inference**: Independent judgment beyond instructions
- **Deviation from design intent**: Differences between AI interpretation and actual intent

### Workload Analysis

**Implementation work load**: Dramatically decreased (1-2 days â†’ under 1 hour)
**Quality management work load**: Dramatically increased (increased frequency of detailed reviews)
**Total work time**: About 2 hours (shortened to 1/4-1/8 of traditional methods)
**Worker cognitive load**: Fatigue increased (dramatic increase in review frequency)

# 5.3 Continuous Improvement and Prompt Optimization

## Introduction

AITDD success cannot be achieved with one-time prompt design. By optimizing prompts through continuous improvement cycles and accumulating organizational knowledge, we achieve stable, high-quality development. In this chapter, we will learn systematic improvement methods and practical optimization techniques.

## Designing Improvement Cycles

### Basic Improvement Cycle

```
Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Evaluate â†’ Improve â†’ Plan...
(Plan) (Do) (Check) (Act)
```

**PDCA Cycle in AITDD:**

**Plan:**

- Set prompt improvement goals
- Define evaluation metrics
- Identify improvement targets

**Do:**

- Execute with modified prompts
- Collect data
- Record results

**Check:**

- Measure output quality
- Evaluate efficiency
- Analyze problems

**Act:**

- Modify prompts
- Update best practices
- Document knowledge

### Improvement Target Areas

**1. Prompt Structure and Content**

- Clarity of instructions
- Appropriateness of constraints
- Effectiveness of examples

**2. Output Quality**

- Code accuracy
- Traffic light classification accuracy
- Appropriateness of TODO items

**3. Efficiency**

- Reduce execution time
- Reduce review effort
- Minimize correction iterations

## Setting Evaluation Metrics

### Quantitative Evaluation Metrics

**Quality Metrics:**

```markdown
## Quality Measurement Items

**Code Quality:**

- Test success rate: Target 95% or higher
- Static analysis errors: 5 or fewer per 1000 lines
- Security vulnerabilities: 0 critical/high severity

**Classification Accuracy:**

- ðŸ”´ Item detection rate: 90% or higher
- ðŸŸ¡/ðŸŸ¢ Item appropriateness: 85% or higher
- Classification consistency: 95% or higher

**Efficiency:**

- Prompt execution time: Within 5 minutes
- Review time: 50% reduction compared to traditional
- Correction iterations: Average 2 or fewer
```

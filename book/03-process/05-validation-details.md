# 3.5 Details of the Validation Step

## Positioning of the Validation Step

The Validation step is one of the most important innovations in AITDD. By adding this step to the traditional TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle, we automate quality assurance and completion decisions for AI-generated code, achieving a more reliable development process.

## Objectives of the Validation Step

### 1. Multi-layered quality assurance

- **Fulfillment of functional requirements**: Planned features are correctly implemented
- **Regression prevention**: No negative impact on existing features
- **Code quality**: Generated code is maintainable and of high quality

### 2. Automated completion decision

- Objective criteria for completion
- Pre-filtering before human review
- Continuous quality monitoring

### 3. Feedback for process improvement

- Understand quality trends of AI-generated code
- Gather information for prompt improvement
- Measure and optimize development efficiency

## Concrete Procedures

### 1. Confirm Green status of existing tests

#### Mandatory condition

All existing tests must be passing as a prerequisite.

```bash
# Run tests
$ npm test

# Expected results
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Ä∫ should login with valid credentials
‚úÖ User Authentication ‚Ä∫ should reject invalid password
‚úÖ User Registration ‚Ä∫ should create user with valid data
‚úÖ User Registration ‚Ä∫ should reject duplicate email
‚úÖ Product Management ‚Ä∫ should create product
‚úÖ Product Management ‚Ä∫ should list products

Tests: 6 passed, 6 total
Time: 2.341s
Coverage: 94%
```

#### If failures occur

```markdown
‚ùå Countermeasures when tests fail

1. Identify failure causes

   - Impact on existing features from new implementation
   - Conflicts in test data
   - Environment-dependent issues

2. Apply fixes

   - Fix problematic code
   - Adjust test data
   - Review environment configuration

3. Confirm by rerunning
   - Re-run all tests
   - Proceed with Validation after confirming success
```

### 2. Check TDD memo files and requirements documents

#### Files to check

```markdown
## Document checklist

### Required files

- doc/implementation/{feature_name}-requirements.md
- doc/implementation/{feature_name}-testcases.md
- doc/todo.md

### Optional files (if present)

- doc/implementation/{test_case_name}-memo.md
- doc/implementation/{feature_name}-architecture.md
```

#### Example of items to confirm

```markdown
# User Registration ‚Äì Requirements Confirmation

## Extract from requirements.md

### Planned features

- [x] New user registration via email/password
- [x] Duplicate email validation
- [x] Password strength check
- [x] Password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Rate limiting (100 req/s) ‚Üê Not implemented

### Extract from testcases.md

### Number of planned test cases: 10

- TC001: Successful user registration
- TC002: Duplicate email error
- TC003: Password mismatch error
- TC004: Invalid email format
- TC005: Insufficient password strength
- TC006: Missing required fields
- TC007: Boundary test ‚Äì email length
- TC008: Rate limiting test
- TC009: Database connection error
- TC010: CSRF token verification
```

### 3. Confirm implemented test cases

#### Analyze test files

```javascript
// Example analysis of __tests__/user-registration.test.js

describe("User Registration", () => {
  // Confirm implemented test cases
  test("TC001: should create user with valid data", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC002: should reject duplicate email", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC003: should reject password mismatch", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC004: should validate email format", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC005: should validate password strength", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC006: should require all fields", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC007: should handle email length limits", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  test("TC010: should verify CSRF token", async () => {
    // Implemented ‚úÖ
  });

  // TC008, TC009 are not implemented
});
```

#### Summarize implementation status

```markdown
## Test-case implementation status

### Implemented: 8

- TC001: Successful user registration ‚úÖ
- TC002: Duplicate email error ‚úÖ
- TC003: Password mismatch error ‚úÖ
- TC004: Invalid email format ‚úÖ
- TC005: Insufficient password strength ‚úÖ
- TC006: Missing required fields ‚úÖ
- TC007: Boundary test ‚úÖ
- TC010: CSRF token verification ‚úÖ

### Not implemented: 2

- TC008: Rate limiting test ‚ùå
- TC009: Database connection error ‚ùå

### Implementation rate: 80% (8/10)
```

### 4. Analyze implementation status and decide whether to update TODO.md

#### Quality risk evaluation by AI

```markdown
## Example AI analysis report

### Evaluation of implementation completeness

- Basic-function implementation rate: 100%
- Test-case implementation rate: 80%
- Requirement fulfillment rate: 90%

### Importance analysis of unimplemented items

#### TC008: Rate limiting test

- Importance: Medium (security-related)
- Impact: Risk of abuse in production
- Implementation priority: Medium

#### TC009: Database connection error

- Importance: High (availability-related)
- Impact: Stability of the whole system
- Implementation priority: High

### Quality risk evaluation

- Security risk: Medium (rate limiting not implemented)
- Availability risk: High (behavior unknown during DB failures)
- Maintainability risk: Low (code quality good)

### Recommended actions

1. Prioritize implementation of TC009 (DB connection error)
2. Plan to implement TC008 (rate limiting) next
3. Proceed to the next step with caution
```

## Decision Criteria for Validation

### ‚úÖ Fully implemented (proceed automatically)

```markdown
### Completion criteria

- Existing tests: All green ‚úÖ
- Test-case implementation rate: 100% ‚úÖ
- Completion rate of important features: 100% ‚úÖ
- Quality risks: None ‚úÖ
- Security check: Passed ‚úÖ

### Automatic decision

```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Insufficient implementation (additional work required)

```markdown
### Continuation criteria (Example 1: Critical unimplemented items)

- Existing tests: All green ‚úÖ
```

### Continuation criteria (Example 2: Existing tests failing)

- Existing tests: Failures present ‚ùå
- Test-case implementation rate: 90% ‚úÖ
- Completion rate of important features: 95% ‚úÖ

### Decision

‚ùå Regression test failing ‚Äî return to Green/Refactor to fix

````

### üîç Needs judgment (human review required)

```markdown
### Cases that are difficult to judge

- Test-case implementation rate: 85% (borderline)
- Unimplemented items: Hard to judge importance
- Quality risks: Organization-specific judgment required
- Business requirements: Ambiguity in interpretation

### Decision

üîç Human review requested ‚Äî requires expert judgment
````

## AI-Driven Decision Process

### 1. Information gathering and analysis

#### Input information

```markdown
## Input data for running Validation

### Technical information

- Test execution results (details of passes/failures)
- Code coverage report
- Static analysis results (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
- Performance test results

### Specification information

- requirements.md (functional/non-functional requirements)
- testcases.md (list of test cases)
- architecture.md (architecture design)

### Project information

- Existing codebase
- Dependency information
- Environment configuration
```

#### Analysis method

```markdown
## AI analysis approach

### 1. Quantitative analysis

- Calculate test-case implementation rate
- Evaluate code coverage
- Measure complexity metrics
- Check performance indicators

### 2. Qualitative analysis

- Confirm consistency between requirements and implementation
- Subjective evaluation of code quality
- Check security requirements
- Evaluate maintainability

### 3. Risk evaluation

- Analyze impact of unimplemented features
- Evaluate security risks
- Evaluate operational risks
- Evaluate technical debt
```

### 2. Decision logic

#### Hierarchical decision system

```markdown
## Priority of decisions

### Level 1: Critical issues (immediate continuation)

1. Existing tests failing
2. Critical security issues
3. Risk of data corruption

### Level 2: Missing important features (continuation recommended)

1. Unimplemented basic functions
2. Insufficient error handling for important cases
3. Missing required validations

### Level 3: Quality standards (threshold-based)

1. Test coverage < 80%
2. Test-case implementation rate < 90%
3. Complexity > allowed threshold

### Level 4: Overall decision (Complete/Continue/Needs judgment)

- Final decision considering all of the above
- Compare with organization‚Äôs quality standards
- Consider project context
```

#### Example decision prompt

## Traffic Light System for Inference Visualization

### Utilizing the Traffic Light System

In the Validation step, we visualize AI's inferred parts to improve human review efficiency.

#### üü¢ Green Light (High Confidence)
```markdown
## Content clearly inferable from source files

### Example: Test case implementation status
- üü¢ TC001 implemented (corresponding test exists in test file)
- üü¢ Basic functionality verified (test success results exist)
- üü¢ Error handling implemented (specified in requirements)
````

#### üü° Yellow Light (Caution - Requires Confirmation)

```markdown
## Content supplemented by inference but seems reasonable

### Example: Quality assessment

- üü° Code coverage 80% is sufficient (judgment based on general standards)
- üü° Performance requirements unmeasured but no problem (inferred from implementation)
- üü° Security risk medium (estimated due to unimplemented rate limiting)
```

#### üî¥ Red Light (Requires Verification)

```markdown
## Content not in source files, based on independent judgment

### Example: Business judgment

- üî¥ Rate limiting implementation priority "medium" (organization policy unclear)
- üî¥ DB connection error handling required (operational requirements unconfirmed)
- üî¥ Sufficient for next implementation (project schedule unclear)
```

### Management in TODO Format

```markdown
## Validation Results TODO

### üü¢ High Confidence Items (Recommended for confirmation)

- [ ] Confirm TC001-007 implementation completion in [testcases.md](./testcases.md)
- [ ] Confirm 100% implementation of basic functions in [requirements](./requirements.md)

### üü° Medium Confidence Items (Requires confirmation)

- [ ] Confirm performance characteristics of [implementation code](./src/users.js)
- [ ] Confirm compliance with [security requirements](./requirements.md)

### üî¥ Items Requiring Judgment (Important)

- [ ] Detailed confirmation: Determine implementation priority of [unimplemented items](./testcases.md) based on organization standards
- [ ] Detailed confirmation: Confirm DB failure requirements in [operational requirements](./requirements.md)
- [ ] Detailed confirmation: Adjust implementation plan based on project schedule
```

# AITDD Getting Started – Understand AI‑Assisted TDD in 10 Minutes

## What is AITDD?

AITDD (AI + Test‑Driven Development) is a modern development method that uses AI to streamline TDD. By combining TDD with AI assistance, you can dramatically increase development speed while maintaining high software quality.

## How it differs from traditional development

### Traditional development

- Write code manually line by line
- Spend a lot of time on implementation
- Strongly dependent on individual skills

### AITDD

- AI assists code generation
- Implementation workload is greatly reduced
- Tests ensure quality while moving fast

## Basic AITDD flow

1. TODO creation — clarify what to build
2. Specification — decide details together with AI
3. Test creation — express expected behavior in tests
4. Implementation — have AI generate code
5. Validation — humans do the final check

Repeat this cycle to efficiently build reliable software.

## What projects is it good for?

### Especially effective

- Projects with a lot of similar code
  - CRUD operations
  - API development
  - Form validation
- JavaScript and Python projects
  - AI can easily look up library information

### Use with care

- When extremely high performance is required
- Compiled languages like Java and C# (benefits are limited)

## Tools

### Claude Sonnet 4

- Main AI assistant
- Supports everything from code generation to quality checks
- Prompt writing is key

### Development environment

- Your usual editor/IDE
- A test execution environment
- Version control (Git)

## Example development

### Example: simple task management

1. TODO: "Create a feature to add/delete/change completion status of tasks"
2. Specification: decide details with AI
   - Task data structure
   - Required API endpoints
   - Error handling
3. Test creation: express expected behavior in tests
4. Implementation: AI generates code that passes the tests
5. Validation: verify behavior and quality

## Benefits

- Development speed: several times faster than traditional
- Quality stability: ensured by tests
- Learning effect: learn new techniques from AI‑generated code
- Creativity: less implementation work, more focus on design

## Notes

- Do not fully rely on AI: humans make the final decisions
- Prompt design: instructions to AI affect quality
- Continuous improvement: refine the process through practice

## Three steps to get started

### Step 1: Prepare the environment

- Get a Claude Sonnet 4 account
- Prepare your development environment

### Step 2: Start small

- Start with simple CRUD operations
- Practice writing prompts

### Step 3: Continuous improvement

- Improve the process through practice
- Share knowledge within the team

## Summary

AITDD is a way to develop high‑quality software efficiently with the help of AI. Rather than leaving everything to AI, humans and AI collaborate to achieve speeds and quality previously unthinkable.

Start with a small project to feel the effect of AITDD. Through practice, you will discover your own AITDD style.

## AITDD Introduction - Understanding AI-Powered Test-Driven Development in 10 Minutes

## What is AITDD?

AITDD (AI + Test-Driven Development) is a new development methodology that uses AI to streamline test-driven development. By combining the power of AI with traditional TDD, you can dramatically improve development speed while creating high-quality software.

## How It Differs from Traditional Development

### Traditional Development

- Write code line by line manually
- Spend much time on implementation
- Heavily dependent on individual skills

### AITDD

- AI assists with code generation
- Implementation burden is significantly reduced
- High-speed development while ensuring quality through testing

## Basic AITDD Flow

1. **TODO Creation** - Clearly define what to build
2. **Specification Development** - Decide details together with AI
3. **Test Creation** - Express expected behavior through tests
4. **Implementation** - Have AI generate code
5. **Verification** - Human final check

By repeating this flow, you efficiently build reliable software.

## What Projects is it Suitable For?

### Particularly Effective

- **Projects requiring much similar code**
  - CRUD operations
  - API development
  - Form validation
- **JavaScript・Python** projects
  - AI can easily research library information

### Requires Caution

- When extremely high performance is required
- Compiled languages like Java・C# (effect is limited)

## Tools to Use

### Claude Sonnet 4

- Main AI assistant
- Handles everything from code generation to quality checking
- Prompt (instruction) writing is key

### Development Environment

- Your usual editor/IDE
- Test execution environment
- Version control (Git)

## Actual Development Example

### Example: Simple Task Management Feature

1. **TODO**: "Create functionality to add, delete, and change completion status of tasks"

2. **Specification Development**: Decide details through dialogue with AI

   - Task data structure
   - Required API endpoints
   - Error handling

3. **Test Creation**: Express expected behavior through test code

4. **Implementation**: AI generates code that passes tests

5. **Verification**: Operation confirmation and quality checking

## Benefits

- **Development Speed**: Can develop at several times traditional speed
- **Quality Stability**: Quality assurance through testing
- **Learning Effect**: Can learn new technologies from AI-generated code
- **Creativity**: Reduced implementation work allows focus on design

## Important Points

- **Don't completely depend on AI**: Humans make final decisions
- **Prompt Design**: Quality changes based on how you instruct AI
- **Continuous Improvement**: Improve process through practice

## 3 Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Environment Preparation

- Get Claude Sonnet 4 account
- Set up development environment

### Step 2: Start Small

- Begin with simple CRUD operations
- Practice prompt writing

### Step 3: Continuous Improvement

- Improve process through practice
- Share knowledge within team

## Summary

AITDD is a methodology for efficiently developing high-quality software with AI assistance. Rather than completely relying on AI, human-AI collaboration achieves unprecedented speed and quality.

Start with small projects to experience AITDD's effectiveness. Through practice, your own AITDD style will emerge.

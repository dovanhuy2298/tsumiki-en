# 8.2 Documentation and Maintainability

We explain documentation strategies and practical methods for building sustainable, maintainable software in AITDD.

## TDD Process-Linked Documentation

### Automated Document Generation at Each Step

We adopt a systematic approach where AI outputs documentation at each step in AITDD's extended TDD process (Red-Green-Refactor-Validation).

#### Step-by-Step Document Generation Strategy

**Red Step**: Test requirements and test case design documents

- Test case design intent
- Specifications for expected behavior
- Requirements definition for test target functionality

**Green Step**: Implementation specifications and implementation content explanations

- Implementation policies and approaches
- Explanation of major algorithms
- Rationale for technical decisions in implementation

**Refactor Step**: Refactoring policies and changes

- Purpose and effects of refactoring
- Detailed explanation of changed parts
- Quality improvement perspectives

**Validation Step**: Quality check results and verification reports

- Quality confirmation items and their results
- Discovered issues and countermeasures
- Final quality assessment

### Automated Document Creation Procedures

#### Prompt Integration Method

```
# Example prompt for Green step
When implementing, please also generate the following documentation:
- implementation-notes.md: Implementation policies and technical decisions
- api-spec.md: Detailed API specifications
- deployment-guide.md: Deployment procedures
```

#### AI-Led Content Decisions

- **AI automatically determines what to write in files**: Developers don't need to specify specific content
- **Ensure consistency**: Consistent document creation through information linkage between steps
- **Reduce effort**: Minimize manual documentation creation work
- **Maintain quality**: High-quality documents through AI's text generation capabilities

### Ensuring Continuity Through File Linkage

#### Carrying Forward Previous Step Information

Practical information inheritance methods:

```bash
# Prompt example: Reference previous step deliverables
Please read the following files and execute the next step while maintaining consistency:
- test-design.md (Red step deliverables)
- implementation-notes.md (Green step deliverables)
```

#### Automated File Management Procedures

- **File name pattern specification**: Describe file name patterns when instructing each step
- **Automatic reading**: AI automatically reads necessary files
- **Multiple file simultaneous reference**: Reference multiple files simultaneously as needed
- **Context inheritance**: Automatically carry forward previous step deliverables to next step

## Comment Strategy for AI-Generated Code

### Rich Comment Generation

#### Comment Generation Policy

Effective comment strategy utilizing AI:

- **More comments**: Request AI to generate detailed comments when generating code
- **Function explanation**: Clarify purpose and behavior of each function/method
- **Implementation intent**: Background on why that implementation method was chosen
- **Usage instructions**: Document how to call and points to note

#### Sample-Based Comment Generation

```typescript
// Sample: Present AI with implementation examples with comments
/**
 * Perform user authentication
 * @param credentials - Authentication information (username and password)
 * @returns Promise<AuthResult> - Authentication result
```

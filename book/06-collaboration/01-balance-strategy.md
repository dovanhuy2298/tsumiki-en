# 6.1 Balance Strategy to Avoid Over-dependence

To effectively utilize AITDD, it's important to maximize AI's power while maintaining the developer's own creativity and judgment. This section explains appropriate role division between AI and humans and practical strategies to avoid over-dependence.

## Problems from Over-dependence on AI

### Main Challenges

One of the biggest challenges in AITDD is that **over-relying on AI makes it difficult for developers to incorporate their own intentions and thoughts**. This problem occurs not only with Claude Sonnet 4 but also with other AI tools, causing the following effects:

- **Design Judgment**: Easily swayed by AI suggestions, limiting independent judgment
- **Creativity**: Difficulty generating unique ideas and solutions
- **Learning Opportunities**: Reduced opportunities to think independently, affecting skill improvement

### Lessons from Vibe Coding

In the development process of AITDD methodology, many experience an early stage called "vibe coding." This is a **coding technique that uses AI with momentum and feeling**, but it has the following limitations:

- One implementation is very fast, but reaches **limits at around 3-function integration**
- AI **generates large amounts of code** that wasn't requested
- **Completely different implementations** from the same request, lacking consistency
- Results in situations where **manual work is faster**

## Establishing Appropriate Role Division

### Areas Humans Should Handle

In AITDD, the area where humans should exercise the most creativity is **requirements definition and design**:

#### Most Important Area: Requirements Definition and Design

- **Imagining "what you want to do"** is the biggest creativity exercise point
- Deciding problem-solving direction
- Source of value creation
- Process of converting business requirements to system requirements

#### Human Expertise Areas

- **Goal Setting**: Defining project objectives and success metrics
- **Value Judgment**: Deciding feature priorities and quality requirements
- **Creative Thinking**: Proposing new approaches and solutions
- **System-wide Consistency**: Ensuring consistency at the architecture level

### Areas Where AI Excels

On the other hand, AI can effectively support humans in the following areas:

- **Implementation Support**: Code generation and detailed implementation
- **Quality Improvement**: Test case generation and bug detection
- **Efficiency**: Automation of routine tasks
- **Documentation Generation**: Creating comments and design documents

## Practical Balance Strategies

### 1. Visualizing AI's Inferred Content

Making AI's decision process transparent enables appropriate supervision and correction:

#### Current Efforts

- Marking AI's inferred/completed parts through prompt design
- Introducing mechanisms to mark AI-inferred content
- Visualizing uncertain judgments

#### Future Development Direction

- Building complete visualization systems for AI's inferred content
- Reducing black box problems
- Achieving more precise human supervision

### 2. Clarifying Checkpoints

Clearly defining what humans should check enables efficient reviews:

#### Setting Checkpoints

- **Purpose**: Understanding what humans should check
- **Effect**: Achieving efficient reviews
- **Quality**: Preventing oversight of important judgments

#### Specific Check Items

- AI hasn't implemented features that weren't requested
- Implementation method fits requirements
- Consistency with existing systems is maintained
- Future extensibility is considered

### 3. Progressive Improvement Approach

It's important to improve AI collaboration progressively:

#### Improvement Steps

1. **Current**: Recognizing issues and considering solution directions
2. **Next**: Introducing marking mechanisms in prompt design
3. **Future**: Complete visualization systems for AI's inferred content

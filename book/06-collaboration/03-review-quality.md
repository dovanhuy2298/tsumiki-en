# 6.3 Reviews and Quality Management

Quality management under AITDD requires a different approach from traditional development. By understanding the nature of AI‑generated code and using human judgment appropriately, we can build high‑quality software efficiently. This section details effective reviews and quality management in AITDD environments.

## Peculiarities of AI Code Reviews

### Characteristics of AI‑generated code

- Illusion of completeness: outputs look finished → risk of rubber‑stamping; counter with intentionally critical reviews
- Over‑implementation: AI adds lots of code not requested → increased complexity and lower maintainability
- Inconsistency: same request can yield different styles → ignore existing patterns

### Differences from traditional reviews

```markdown
# Review perspective comparison

## Traditional code review

- Implementation soundness
- Coding standards
- Bugs
- Maintainability/readability

## AI code review (additional)

- Presence of out‑of‑scope implementation ★important
- Consistency with existing code
- Validity of AI’s rationale
- Over‑feature checks
```

## Review Points and Checklists

### 1) Instruction compliance

Focus on “did it implement anything we didn’t ask for?”

```markdown
# Instruction compliance checklist

## Scope

□ Only requested features are implemented
□ No extra features added
□ No ad‑hoc logic not in the spec

## Implementation method

□ Follows the specified policy
□ No forbidden techniques used
□ Does not deviate from existing patterns

## Data structures

□ Uses the specified formats
□ No schema changes slipped in
□ No unnecessary fields added
```

### 2) Consistency with the existing system

- Architecture alignment: patterns, layer boundaries, dependencies
- Code style: naming, formatting, comment style

### 3) Improve quality via rationale checks

Use AI to confirm the basis of decisions:

```markdown
# AI rationale confirmation flow

## Step 1: Ask for rationale

“What is the basis for this implementation? Point out any parts not explicit in the spec.”

## Step 2: Judge by AI’s answer

### Pattern A: “No rationale”

→ Human decides accept/reject; if reject, adjust instructions and re‑run

### Pattern B: Rationale provided

→ Humans evaluate its validity and adjust as needed
```

## Quality Management across TDD Steps

### Red (test design quality)

Ensure clarity of test purpose/expected values and sufficient edge case coverage, as well as test independence.

### Green (implementation quality)

Key points during implementation:

```markdown
# Green step checks

## Implementation appropriateness

□ Minimal implementation needed to pass tests
□ Avoid over‑engineering
□ Avoid over‑anticipating future

## Code quality

□ Follow coding standards
□ Proper exception handling
□ Proper logging

## Performance

□ No unnecessary processing
□ Optimized DB access
□ Proper memory usage
```

### Refactor (quality improvement)

Confirm readability, duplication removal, and proper separation of responsibilities; ensure tests still pass and docs are updated.

### Validation (comprehensive checks)

1. Fulfillment of planned test cases; 2) Regression on existing tests; 3) Source quality checks (standards, maintainability, readability).

## Team‑level Quality Strategies

### Review process shift

As roles shift from “create” to “verify,” adapt the review flow:

```markdown
# AITDD‑ready review flow

## 1. Pre‑check by implementer

- First pass by implementer
- Instruction compliance
- Fix obvious issues

## 2. Peer review

- Review by another developer
- Validate design decisions
- Check architectural alignment

## 3. AI rationale review

- Confirm AI’s rationale
- Clarify inferred parts
- Surface uncertain judgments

## 4. Approve & merge

- Final quality judgment
- Risk evaluation and release readiness
```

### Managing quality in parallel development

Use branching strategies (e.g., git worktree) and run comprehensive tests before merges; ensure progress/intent sharing and early issue detection.

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

### Quality metrics for AI‑generated code

Instruction compliance rate, bug detection rate, test coverage, technical debt accumulation; efficiency metrics like review time reduction, fewer revisions, and shorter time‑to‑release.

### Improvement cycle

```markdown
# Quality improvement cycle

## 1. Collect problems

- Categorize review findings
- Identify frequent patterns
- Analyze root causes

## 2. Improve prompts

- Design prompts that prevent issues
- Make instructions more specific
- Clarify constraints

## 3. Improve process

- Update checklists
- Expand review items
- Identify automation candidates

## 4. Verify effects

- Measure post‑improvement metrics
- Track issue occurrence changes
- Identify further improvements
```

## Quality Assurance through Automation

### CI/CD pipeline checks (example)

```yaml
# Automated quality checks (GitHub Actions)
name: AI Code Quality Check
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  quality-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Code quality check
        run: |
          # ESLint
          npx eslint . --ext .js,.ts
          # Complexity
          npx complexity-report --format json src/
          # Security
          npm audit

      - name: AI implementation verification
        run: |
          # Custom script to detect out-of-scope implementation
          node scripts/check-ai-implementation.js
```

### Static analysis tuned for AI output

Use custom ESLint rules, SonarQube quality gates, CodeClimate for debt, and Snyk for security to catch AI‑specific issues (unused imports, abnormal complexity, naming mismatches, vulnerabilities).

## Success Cases

Record concrete examples where prompt/process improvements reduced over‑implementation and improved readability, and how staged quality bars and education/support improved team adoption.

## Summary

AITDD quality management hinges on understanding AI code and applying human judgment. With instruction compliance, rationale checks, automation, and continuous improvement, you can deliver high quality efficiently. The next chapter covers real‑world cases and learnings.

# 6.3 Review and Quality Management

Quality management in AITDD requires a significantly different approach from traditional development methods. By understanding the characteristics of AI-generated code and appropriately utilizing human judgment, we can efficiently develop high-quality software. This section explains in detail practical methods for effective review and quality management in AITDD environments.

## Special Characteristics of AI Code Review

### Characteristics of AI-Generated Code

AI-generated code has the following unique characteristics that require special attention during review:

#### Illusion of Completeness

- **Challenge**: AI-written content appears completely finished
- **Risk**: Danger of passing review without much thought
- **Countermeasure**: Intentionally implement critical perspective review

#### Tendency Toward Over-Implementation

- **Characteristic**: AI generates **large amounts of code not requested**
- **Problem**: Addition of unrequested functionality
- **Impact**: Increased system complexity and decreased maintainability

#### Lack of Consistency

- **Same request easily produces completely different implementations**
- Tendency to ignore existing code styles
- Lack of unity across the entire system

### Differences from Traditional Review

```markdown
# Review Perspective Comparison

## Traditional Code Review

- Validity of implementation methods
- Compliance with coding standards
- Presence of bugs
- Maintainability and readability

## AI Code Review (Additional Perspectives)

- Presence of unrequested implementations ★ Important
- Consistency with existing code
- Validity of AI's decision rationale
- Confirmation of excessive functionality addition
```

## Review Points and Check Items

### 1. Instruction Compliance Check

The most important review point is confirming **"whether things not requested are written"**:

#### Specific Check Items

```markdown
# Instruction Compliance Checklist

## Functionality Scope

□ Is only the requested functionality implemented?
□ Are unnecessary functions not added?
□ Are judgment logics not specified in requirements included?

## Implementation Method

□ Does it follow the specified implementation approach?
□ Are prohibited technologies or methods not used?
□ Does it not deviate from existing patterns?

## Data Structure

□ Are specified data formats used?
□ Are schemas not arbitrarily changed?
□ Are unnecessary fields not added?
```

#### Practical Review Methods

```markdown
# Review Practice Example

## Original Instruction

"Implement user search functionality by username"

## Review AI's Implementation

✓ Good example: Simple search by username only
✗ Bad example: Also implemented email, phone number, partial matching

## Review Comment Example

"Partial matching search is not in this requirement.
Please modify to exact username matching only."
```

### 2. Consistency with Existing System Check

Confirmation that AI-generated code can be appropriately integrated with the existing system:

#### Architectural Alignment

- Consistency with existing design patterns
- Compliance with layer boundaries
- Appropriate dependencies

#### Code Style Uniformity

- Uniform naming conventions
- Consistent formatting
- Uniform comment style

### 3. Quality Improvement via Rationale Checks

Perform quality checks using AI to confirm the basis of decisions:

#### Rationale Confirmation Process

```markdown
# AI Rationale Confirmation Process

## Step 1: Request Rationale

"What is the basis for this implementation? Point out any parts not explicitly specified in the requirements."

## Step 2: Judge by AI's Answer

### Pattern A: "No Rationale"

→ Human decides accept/reject; if reject, adjust instructions and re‑run

### Pattern B: Rationale Provided

→ Humans evaluate its validity and adjust as needed
```

#### Practical Rationale Confirmation Example

```markdown
# Practical Rationale Confirmation Example

## Reviewer's Question

"Why did you implement caching here?"

## AI's Answer Example 1 (With Rationale)

"Because the performance requirement specified 'search should be within 0.5 seconds', and it was determined that caching of frequently accessed data was necessary."
→ Accept because rationale is clear

## AI's Answer Example 2 (Without Rationale)

"Added as a general best practice. No clear requirement specified."
→ Consider deletion
```

## Quality Management Across TDD Steps

### Red (Test Design Quality)

Ensure clarity of test purpose/expected values and sufficient edge case coverage, as well as test independence.

□ Avoid over‑engineering
□ Avoid over‑anticipating future

## Code Quality

□ Follow coding standards
□ Proper exception handling
□ Proper logging

## Performance

□ No unnecessary processing
□ Optimized DB access
□ Proper memory usage
```

### Refactor (Quality Improvement)

Confirm readability, duplication removal, and proper separation of responsibilities; ensure tests still pass and docs are updated.
